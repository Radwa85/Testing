# About me

I am Radwa Mohamed, a committed Software Tester and Computer and Automatic Control Engineering student at Tanta University, specializing in both manual and automated testing to uphold high standards of software quality and reliability. My experience includes working as a Software Tester for the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI), where I contributed to testing the ITC platform as part of my graduation project, enhancing my skills in identifying, reporting, and resolving software issues.

With hands-on experience testing applications like Saree3 and El Menus, I’ve honed my skills in API testing, bug reporting, and project management. My training in ISTQB standards and familiarity with tools like Postman, Trello, and JIRA support my effectiveness in delivering dependable software solutions.
